CarparkFinder is...
=============

My attempt to write a carpark finder using google maps with a scraper that saves those points to Google App Engine. Everything else seems to be fine tho, except I can't get GeoModel to return results (see main.py, LocationHandler#get) . AppEngine's support for Geospatial queries is too much for my Python skillz. Or maybe, I think I'm missing something. helpz?

So what's next?
===

Rewriting the backend to sinatra instead. And leave this on github as a remembrance for my epic failure and how appengine has ruined my day today.
